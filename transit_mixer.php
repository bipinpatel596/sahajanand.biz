                        <p class="sec-textmb-30">PTM Series introduces by Sahajanand Sales & Service, for India & Overseas, indigenously developed Transit Mixer. The Transit Mixer is a very resourceful product of Sahajanand Sales & Service; the mixer can produce concrete with various capacities 2 m3, 4 m3 & 6m3 capacity.</p>


                        <h5 class="sec-title page-title">Description</h5>
                        <p class="sec-textmb-30">Sahajanand Sales & Service Transit Mixer is a strong well designed piece of equipment meant for transporting concrete / mortar from concrete batching plant directly to the place where it is to be poured. It has a wide range of application especially for mass concreting works like Construction of Canals, Bridges, Highways, Dams, Multistoried & Industrial Buildings, Factories, and Airports and for ready mixed Concrete Works</p>
                        <p class="sec-textmb-30">Sahajanand Sales & Service Transit Mixer is fully hydrostatic mounted on truck chassis. Hydrostatic power is transmitted by a high pressure axial piston type pump and motor, which permits infinite varying drum speed from 0 to 14 rpm in both directions. The control of pump gives flow to a high pressure hydraulic motor, which rotates the mixer drum through an epicyclic gear reducer. The mixer drum has double spiral type mixing blade inside it which ensures efficient mixing without segregation & smooth flow of concrete while discharging. The mixer drum & spiral are made from highly durable steel.</p>
