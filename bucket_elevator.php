                        <p class="sec-textmb-30">Bucket elevators are designed to move flowing powders or bulk solids vertically. The typical elevator consists of a series of buckets mounted on a chain or belt operating over a sprocket or pulley. Take-ups are provided as a means to compensate for variations in length of chain or belt due to temperature changes, atmospheric conditions, or wear. A steel casing encloses the bucket line. Head sections and boot sections house integral transmission components.</p>
                        <p class="sec-textmb-30">Material is fed into an inlet hopper. Buckets (or cups) dig into the Material, and convey it up to and over the head sprocket/pulley, then throwing the material out the discharge throat. The emptied buckets then continue back down to the boot to continue the cycle.</p>
