                        <p class="sec-textmb-30">The Industrial Belt Conveyor is mainly of two kinds. One which is used for handling general material like the moving boxes inside the factories, and the other which is used for transporting not just industrial but agricultural materials as well, like grain, ores, coal, and others. This belt conveyor is useful for both indoor and outdoor purposes. These belts seek to save lot of time, money and even physical labor. It is not just economical but also low in maintenance.</p>
                        

                        <h5 class="sec-title page-title">Description</h5>
                        <p class="sec-textmb-30">The Belt Conveyor is designed and installed in such a way so as to meet the bulk material handling and transferring needs. The Conveyor not just saves time and money but also saves a lot of physical labor when it comes to transferring of and handling of bulk materials like food products, fertilizers, cement, cement mixtures and so on. It generally consists of two or more pulleys and a continuous loop, which is the conveyor belt to rotate above them. It seeks to use a wide belt and the pulleys supported by the rollers or even a flat pan along its way.</p>
